# Hello World

I made this following Derek Banas' **[Android Studio tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBD4xhH5vIE)**. It's little more than a Hello World.

I appreciated the introduction and getting something running on my phone. But I never absord much from video lessons, and think I will henceforth use more descriptive written tutorials, at least until I have a firmer grasp of what I'm actually doing when setting up a basic app.
